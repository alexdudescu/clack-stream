# Clack utils

Rxjs wrappers and utils for [clack](https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack)

## Motivation
With a strong background in frontend development and recently dabbling into CLI tool creation I have found myself drawn to using streams for controlling user interactions.

Benefits are mainly the same as for the browser making it easy to have clean reusable bits of code for building your tooling.
